      <h2>Return to Abbey Road</h2>
      <p>Ninety days after the 6 June session, the Beatles returned to Abbey Road to record the two titles for their first single. They flew down from Liverpool Airport in the morning, checked into a small Chelsea hotel and arrived at Abbey Road shortly after lunch.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Strict Studio Rules</h2>
      <p>Recording studio practice in 1962 was strictly regimented. There were three sessions per day: 10.00am-1.00pm, 2.30-5.30pm and 7.00-10.00pm. After that, unless overtime had been agreed and the appropriate Musicians' Union form signed, the day's work would be at an end. (The Beatles' 6 June session was held early, from 6.00-8.00pm, in order to allow the group to drive back north the same evening.) As this book will show, the Beatles successfully challenged this routine and changed - probably forever - the way studios operate.</p>
      <p>Stringent timekeeping was not the only curiously staid studio institution back in 1962. Technical engineers still went around in white coats, and in fact continued to do so at Abbey Road until the 1970s. Winston Churchill, before he became 'Sir', visited the studios on one memorable occasion and observing the white-coated staff as he struggled up the steps paused merely to wheeze, "My God, I think I've come to the wrong place. It looks like a hospital."</p>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Afternoon Rehearsal</h2>
        <p>Between 2.30 and 5.30pm Ron Richards ran the Beatles through a vigorous rehearsal in studio three, with photographer Dezo Hoffmann in attendance.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "I remember that we rehearsed 'Please Please Me'," says Richards. "George was playing the opening phrase, later done by John on his harmonica, over and over and over, throughout the song. I said 'For Christ's sake, George, just play it in the gaps!'"
      </blockquote>
        <p>In all, the Beatles practised six songs, from which two were selected for recording in the evening session, starting at 7.00pm. One was an automatic choice - 'How Do You Do It' - which George Martin was insisting, in the apparent absence of any stronger original material, would be the group's first single.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>George Martin’s Choice</h2>
      <blockquote>
        "'How Do You Do It' was brought into my office by the man who wrote it, Mitch Murray, along with Barry Mason, later to write a number of hits himself," recalls Richards. "They offered me first option on the recording and played me Mitch's demonstration acetate. I liked it so much that I immediately called Dick James, the singer turned music publisher, and he signed the song up straightaway. But the acetate stayed in my desk for a long time after that. We didn't know who to give it to. Much later, when George was pondering about the Beatles' first record, I played him Mitch's acetate. He felt that it would be ideal for them and sent a copy to Liverpool right away so that they could learn their parts."
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>The Beatles’ Resistance</h2>
      <p>The Beatles themselves felt that the song was absolutely not for them, and they told George Martin so during the evening recording session. "We want to perform our own material," they said. George's rejoinder was that when they could write a song as good as this one then he would let them do that instead. Until then...</p>
      <p>They recorded the song. "They never shirked on jobs," says Martin. "They didn't really want to do it but in the end they did quite a good job." Listening to it in 1987, it sounds quite pleasant, if innocuous and somewhat lacking in ambition. Clearly the Beatles weren't putting too much effort into it. It must have come very close to being released though, because a finished, mastered version of the tape exists in the EMI archive along with other tracks released at the time. Were it intended to remain an outtake it would not have been mastered. But history tells us that the Beatles' first single was 'Love Me Do', and their version of 'How Do You Do It' remains unreleased.</p>
      <p>The story had a happy ending. The Beatles' objections led to a lunch appointment between Brian Epstein and Dick James which, in turn, led to James signing up the Beatles' music publishing from January 1963 onwards, an extremely profitable experience. And the song - as recorded during their very first session, on 22 January 1963, by another Epstein-managed Liverpool group, Gerry and the Pacemakers - did go all the way to number one on the charts.</p>

      <h2>Dinner with George Martin</h2>
           <p>Between the rehearsal and recording sessions, from 5.30 to 7.00pm, George Martin took the Beatles and Neil Aspinall out to dinner, where he regaled them with stories of his recording sessions with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan. "I took them to a little Italian place, Alpino, in Marylebone High Street. We all had spaghetti and the cost per course was about 3s 9d (19p). It wasn't exactly over-the-top but they thought it was wonderful, real high living!"</p>
    </section>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Recording Love Me Do</h2>
      <p>After 'How Do You Do It' the Beatles settled down to record 'Love Me Do', first concentrating on the rhythm (backing) track. This took 15 takes to get right. Then the vocals were superimposed, and this too took a long time. The session was far from easy and it ended late into the evening.</p>
      <blockquote>
        Says Norman Smith, "I've a feeling that Paul wasn't too happy with Ringo's drumming, and felt that it could be better. He didn't make too good a job of it. I remember too that there was a fair bit of editing to be done." Ken Townsend recalls the studio equipment they used, extremely primitive compared to today's high technology. "Abbey Road designed its own mixing consoles then. In studio two we had the REDD 37, which had 10 inputs and 2 outputs, with big knobs and levers. Battleship grey was the colour. The tape machines themselves were BTR (British Tape Recorder) models, great hefty jobs. These were originally green but we painted them battleship grey to match the consoles."
      </blockquote>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Mixing & Aftermath</h2>
      <p>Documents show that 'How Do You Do It' and 'Love Me Do' were mixed by Martin and Smith before the day was out, and that an acetate of the two titles was cut for Martin and Epstein to listen to the next morning.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "I looked very hard at 'How Do You Do It', says George Martin, "but in the end I went with 'Love Me Do'. It was quite a good record."
