      <h2>Arrival & First Impressions</h2>
      <p>What, you might wonder, have Darien Angadi, Jill and the Boulevards, Elaine Truss, Thomas Wallis and the Long Riders and the Beatles got in common? The answer is that they were just some of the dozens of young hopefuls who went in 1962 for artists tests/auditions to the lovely old house at 3 Abbey Road, London NW8, built in 1830 and opened as a recording studio in 1931 by The Gramophone Company Ltd, Later EMI.</p>
      <blockquote>
        John Skinner, in charge of security, stood in his smart serge uniform on the studio steps during the summer's evening of 6 June. "The Beatles pulled into the car park in an old white van," he says. "They all looked very thin and weedy, almost under-nourished. Neil Aspinall, their road manager, said that they were the Beatles, here for a session. I thought what a strange name!" The van was unloaded and the group set themselves up in the studio.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Precisely which studio is not clear, for memories of the evening are blurred. Skinner and George Martin recall the session taking place in studio three, as do others not present on the day but members of the studio staff at the time, Malcolm Addey, Harry Moss and Keith Slaughter. Conversely, Chris Neal, Ron Richards, Norman Smith and Ken Townsend all swear that it was held in studio two.</p>
      <p>Memories are equally blurred about whether the session was actually an artist test (to see if the group were any good), a commercial test (to see if the group could work well inside a recording studio) or even the group's first session proper. The relevant studio documentation has long since been destroyed, although an artist test was the most likely event.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Studio Setup & Equipment</h2>
      <p>Ron Richards initially took charge of the session. "I used to do most of our rock 'n' roll," he recalls, "so George asked me to have first look at them." Norman Smith was assigned as balance engineer and, because engineers associated with successful artist tests tend to remain with that artist, Smith was installed as the Beatles' engineer thereafter.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "They had such duff equipment," says Smith. "Ugly unpainted wooden amplifiers, extremely noisy, with earth loops and goodness knows what. There was as much noise coming from the amps as there was from the instruments. Paul's bass amp was particularly bad and it was clear that the session wasn't going to get under way until something was done about it." 
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        Ken Townsend, on duty in the technical department, recalls what followed. "There was no demand that night for Echo Chamber One, right down in the basement, so Norman and I fetched a very large, very heavy Tannoy speaker from there and I soldered a jack socket onto the input stage of a Leak TL12 amplifier. We were soon back in business."
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Tea & Breaks</h2>
      <blockquote>
        While all this was going on the Beatles went for a cup of tea, brewed by studio tea-ladies Miss Hawthorne and Miss Hunt. "They asked me where the nearest café was," says Terry Condon, one of the studio's invaluable odd-job men. "But they didn't go. I nipped into the kitchen and made them something to eat."
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        The equipment wasn't the only thing that made an impression. As they came into the studio Townsend recalls Smith muttering "Good God! What've we got'ere?" "They dressed quite smartly but they just looked so different to anything we had seen before," says Townsend. Chris Neal, these days re-named Cris Neal to avoid confusion with the record producer of the same name, was the second engineer/tape operator, or 'button pusher' as they were impolitely called. "They were wearing black leather coats which is why I suddenly thought 'Ah, Beatles'. I remember George Martin taking a quick look at them and going down to the canteen to have a cup of tea!"
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Session Progress</h2>
      <p>So the session got under way, with Ron Richards at the helm. Four songs were recorded, and although documentation no longer exists, each would have been done in about four or five takes. Paul sang 'Besame Mucho', the old Latin crooner, then they layed down three Lennon-McCartney originals, 'Love Me Do', 'P.S. I Love You' and 'Ask Me Why'.</p>
      <blockquote>
        It was during 'Love Me Do' that Norman Smith pricked up his ears. "Norman said to me 'Go down and pick up George from the canteen and see what he thinks of this'," recalls Neal. So George Martin came up and took over the rest of the session.
      </blockquote>
      <p>When it was over he spoke to the group over the talkback, with them huddled in the far corner of the studio. Then he invited them up to the control room to hear the tapes and discuss technicalities.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "George was giving them a good talking to, explaining about the studio microphones being figure-of-eight, in other words you could stand on either side of them, as opposed to stage mikes which were one-sided," remembers Townsend. "They were really lolling about," says Neal. "Lennon was sitting on a speaker and Harrison, I seem to recall, was lounging on the floor." "We gave them a long lecture about their equipment and what would have to be done about it if they were to become recording artists," says Norman Smith. "They didn't say a word back, not a word, they didn't even nod their heads in agreement. When he finished, George said 'Look, I've laid into you for quite a time, you haven't responded. Is there anything you don't like?' I remember they all looked at each other for a long while, shuffling their feet, then George Harrison took a long look at George and said 'Yeah, I don't like your tie!' That cracked the ice for us and for the next 15-20 minutes they were pure entertainment. When they left to go home George and I just sat there saying 'Phew! What do we think of that lot then?' I had tears running down my face."

      <h2>Music & Surviving Tapes</h2>
      <p>But what of the music? Richards and Martin felt that it was okay, nothing too special. Retrospective judgement in not possible because when it was realised that nothing from that session would be issued, long before anyone could have recognised their historical importance, the tapes - two quarter-inch reels - were destroyed. Remarkably, one of the four songs, 'Besame Mucho', has survived, on a private reel discovered in the early 1980s.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Contract & EMI Signing</h2>
           <p>George Martin was left to decide whether or not to put the group under contract. This seemed to rest on the question of which Beatle he would make the leader. Most groups then had a leader - Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, Shane Fenton and the Fentones. "George and I were walking up Oxford Street one day trying to work out whether it should be Paul - the good looking one - or John, who had the big personality. Neither of us could make up our minds," says Richards. Martin eventually realised that the group was a complete unit and should not be tinkered with. And he decided that he may as well sign them. "I've got nothing to lose," he recalls saying at the time. The standard recording contract was drawn up, it was signed, and the Beatles became an EMI act. The contract was backdated to 4 June, although no one can recall quite why. The likeliest explanation is that this enabled EMI to own the rights to the tapes of the 6 June session, otherwise, legally, they would have belonged to the group. George Martin thinks it may have even been a typing mistake.</p>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Aftermath / Between Sessions</h2>
      <p>Martin may have decided that the group shouldn't be tinkered with, but the group themselves had other ideas. Between 6 June and their next trip to Abbey Road, on 4 September, their drummer, Pete Best, was dismissed from the group in favour of Ringo Starr, ex of Rory Storm and the Hurricanes.</p>
