      <h2>Return to Abbey Road</h2>
      <p>Ninety days after the 6 June session, the Beatles returned to Abbey Road to record the two titles for their first single. They flew down from Liverpool Airport in the morning, checked into a small Chelsea hotel and arrived at Abbey Road shortly after lunch.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Strict Studio Rules</h2>
      <p>Recording studio practice in 1962 was strictly regimented. There were three sessions per day: 10.00am-1.00pm, 2.30-5.30pm and 7.00-10.00pm. After that, unless overtime had been agreed and the appropriate Musicians' Union form signed, the day's work would be at an end. (The Beatles' 6 June session was held early, from 6.00-8.00pm, in order to allow the group to drive back north the same evening.) As this book will show, the Beatles successfully challenged this routine and changed - probably forever - the way studios operate.</p>
      <p>Stringent timekeeping was not the only curiously staid studio institution back in 1962. Technical engineers still went around in white coats, and in fact continued to do so at Abbey Road until the 1970s. Winston Churchill, before he became 'Sir', visited the studios on one memorable occasion and observing the white-coated staff as he struggled up the steps paused merely to wheeze, "My God, I think I've come to the wrong place. It looks like a hospital."</p>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Afternoon Rehearsal</h2>
        <p>Between 2.30 and 5.30pm Ron Richards ran the Beatles through a vigorous rehearsal in studio three, with photographer Dezo Hoffmann in attendance.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "I remember that we rehearsed 'Please Please Me'," says Richards. "George was playing the opening phrase, later done by John on his harmonica, over and over and over, throughout the song. I said 'For Christ's sake, George, just play it in the gaps!'"
      </blockquote>
        <p>In all, the Beatles practised six songs, from which two were selected for recording in the evening session, starting at 7.00pm. One was an automatic choice - 'How Do You Do It' - which George Martin was insisting, in the apparent absence of any stronger original material, would be the group's first single.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Session Progress</h2>
      <p>So the session got under way, with Ron Richards at the helm. Four songs were recorded, and although documentation no longer exists, each would have been done in about four or five takes. Paul sang 'Besame Mucho', the old Latin crooner, then they layed down three Lennon-McCartney originals, 'Love Me Do', 'P.S. I Love You' and 'Ask Me Why'.</p>
      <blockquote>
        It was during 'Love Me Do' that Norman Smith pricked up his ears. "Norman said to me 'Go down and pick up George from the canteen and see what he thinks of this'," recalls Neal. So George Martin came up and took over the rest of the session.
      </blockquote>
      <p>When it was over he spoke to the group over the talkback, with them huddled in the far corner of the studio. Then he invited them up to the control room to hear the tapes and discuss technicalities.</p>
      <blockquote>
        "George was giving them a good talking to, explaining about the studio microphones being figure-of-eight, in other words you could stand on either side of them, as opposed to stage mikes which were one-sided," remembers Townsend. "They were really lolling about," says Neal. "Lennon was sitting on a speaker and Harrison, I seem to recall, was lounging on the floor." "We gave them a long lecture about their equipment and what would have to be done about it if they were to become recording artists," says Norman Smith. "They didn't say a word back, not a word, they didn't even nod their heads in agreement. When he finished, George said 'Look, I've laid into you for quite a time, you haven't responded. Is there anything you don't like?' I remember they all looked at each other for a long while, shuffling their feet, then George Harrison took a long look at George and said 'Yeah, I don't like your tie!' That cracked the ice for us and for the next 15-20 minutes they were pure entertainment. When they left to go home George and I just sat there saying 'Phew! What do we think of that lot then?' I had tears running down my face."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Music & Surviving Tapes</h2>
      <p>But what of the music? Richards and Martin felt that it was okay, nothing too special. Retrospective judgement in not possible because when it was realised that nothing from that session would be issued, long before anyone could have recognised their historical importance, the tapes - two quarter-inch reels - were destroyed. Remarkably, one of the four songs, 'Besame Mucho', has survived, on a private reel discovered in the early 1980s.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Contract & EMI Signing</h2>
           <p>George Martin was left to decide whether or not to put the group under contract. This seemed to rest on the question of which Beatle he would make the leader. Most groups then had a leader - Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, Shane Fenton and the Fentones. "George and I were walking up Oxford Street one day trying to work out whether it should be Paul - the good looking one - or John, who had the big personality. Neither of us could make up our minds," says Richards. Martin eventually realised that the group was a complete unit and should not be tinkered with. And he decided that he may as well sign them. "I've got nothing to lose," he recalls saying at the time. The standard recording contract was drawn up, it was signed, and the Beatles became an EMI act. The contract was backdated to 4 June, although no one can recall quite why. The likeliest explanation is that this enabled EMI to own the rights to the tapes of the 6 June session, otherwise, legally, they would have belonged to the group. George Martin thinks it may have even been a typing mistake.</p>

    <section class="session-section">
      <h2>Aftermath / Between Sessions</h2>
      <p>Martin may have decided that the group shouldn't be tinkered with, but the group themselves had other ideas. Between 6 June and their next trip to Abbey Road, on 4 September, their drummer, Pete Best, was dismissed from the group in favour of Ringo Starr, ex of Rory Storm and the Hurricanes.</p>
